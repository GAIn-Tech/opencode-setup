  "summary": "Applied atomic JSON write pattern to remaining learning and state persistence files",
  "details": "Replaced direct writeFileSync JSON persistence with temp-file plus rename in context-governor, learning-engine anti/positive pattern catalogs, and memory-graph activator state. This reduces mid-write corruption risk while preserving existing fail-soft behavior.",
