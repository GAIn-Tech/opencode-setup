  "summary": "Hardened fresh-machine smoke pipeline with preflight checks and JSON reporting",
  "details": "Updated scripts/smoke-pipeline.mjs with command/file preflight validation, optional step flags (--no-setup, --no-api), per-step duration tracking, structured summary output, and machine-readable --json mode. This improves failure diagnostics and CI/automation friendliness without changing default step behavior.",
