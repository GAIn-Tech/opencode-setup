  "details": "Analyzed 5 core security modules from JARVIS/src/security/: (1) prompt_defense.py - regex-based injection detection + sanitization + risk scoring; (2) trust_boundary.py - fail-closed boundary policy with whitelist flow control; (3) maat_veto_engine.py - cryptographically-signed hard-stop authority; (4) capability_ticket_service.py - signed capability tickets with delegation chains; (5) channel_security.py - channel classification with encryption enforcement. Identified 8 critical security invariants and created 5-week implementation roadmap.",
