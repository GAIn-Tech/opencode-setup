  "summary": "Added provider probe cache metrics visibility and fallback-reason regression coverage",
  "details": "Extended /api/providers responses with cache statistics (size/hits/misses/expired/hitRate) and surfaced them in ProviderHealth UI. Added SkillRL regression tests to ensure quota-aware routing learning is triggered only for quota-related fallback reasons and not non-quota fallback paths.",
