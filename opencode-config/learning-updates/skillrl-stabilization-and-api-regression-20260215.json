  "details": "Updated SkillRLManager persistence to use atomic temp-write+rename with directory creation and failure-safe cleanup, and removed noisy debug logging from learnFromOutcome. Added integration regression tests that exercise dashboard SkillRL API contracts for missing, valid, and malformed state paths. Added a root script to run the regression suite directly.",
