  "summary": "Moved interactive graph to dedicated full-frame route and wired workflow monitor to real run/thread data",
  "details": "Added dedicated /graph page with full-frame InteractiveKnowledgeGraph and optional browser fullscreen mode. Updated sidebar navigation to expose the route and changed Memory hub to link to the full-frame graph instead of embedding a constrained knowledge tab. Rebuilt workflow monitor home page to load /api/runs and /api/runs/[id], select sessions and steps, poll details, and react to /api/events real-time updates. Replaced static WorkflowTree/EvidenceViewer with thread-aware components that show historical runs, step threads, and rich payload rendering for live event timelines.",
