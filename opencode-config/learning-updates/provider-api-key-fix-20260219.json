    "Fix zen provider config (was using wrong DEEPSEEK_API_KEY)",
    "Health check now sources .env to find API keys",
    "Health check dynamically checks providers based on config (not hardcoded list)",
    "Health check warns instead of failing on missing optional provider keys",
    "Add env var alignment check to detect config/.env mismatches"
  ],
  "root_cause": "Health check wasn't sourcing .env and had hardcoded provider list. Config had zen using wrong env var name.",
  "impact": "All 5 API providers now properly detected. Health check catches env var mismatches."
